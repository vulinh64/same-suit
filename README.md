This is my project I did back then when I was studying in school. How time has passed ðŸ˜Š

It took me 8 hours back then to do this program, but now it only took me around half an hour to finish this. I've surely
gone a long way since those years.

## Rules

- Use standard 52-card deck, number of players is from 2 to 5.
- Each player will be assigned a name (no duplication checked is implemented for now, but yeah, this is a simple demo
  and this should be good enough).
- Each player will pick 5 cards initially.
- For each player's turn, they either pick a card from the main card pile, or choose the last card discarded by the
  previous player (you cannot pick any card from the stack of discard cards other than the latest one).
- After picking up, player must then decide which card they wish to discard, which would be put on the stack of
  discarded cards. Next player can then choose the said discarded card or pick a new one from the main card pile.
- The goal of the game is to **form a deck of five cards of the same suit** (Aces, Hearts, Diamonds and Clubs).
- If the card pile is empty whilst none of the players manages to achieve victory, the game ends in a draw.

Yeah, I am tired, so that should be all for now! Feel free to use this source code and do whatever you want with it.
